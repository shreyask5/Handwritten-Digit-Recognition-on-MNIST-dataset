## Introduction

This project aims to develop an application for recognizing handwritten digits using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on the MNIST dataset. The application provides a user interface where users can draw digits using a mouse, and the CNN model predicts the drawn digit.

## Features

- Allows users to draw handwritten digits using a mouse in a Pygame window.
- Utilizes a trained CNN model to predict the digit drawn by the user.
- Displays a red bounding box around the drawn digit and predicts the digit's label.
